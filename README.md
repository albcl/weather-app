# ![weather-app](public/weather.svg) Weather app

Coding task

## Deployed in Netlify

https://quiet-biscotti-61e3a9.netlify.app/

# Running it locally

This project has been developed using `React, Typescript, Vite and PNPM`.

## Scripts

Once the project has been cloned, install it with:

```
pnpm install
```

Then you will be able to run it with:

```
pnpm run dev
```

Its tests can be run using:

```
pnpm run test
```

## Note

In case the project gets cloned to run it locally, and to make it simpler, I have added an `.env` file with the current API token for the time being. In a production scenario, the configuration would be stored in the environment and set by e.g. a CD pipeline.
